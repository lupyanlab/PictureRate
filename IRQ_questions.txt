I rehearse in my mind how someone might respond to a text message before I send it
When I think about someone I know well, I instantly hear their voice in my mind
When I think about someone I know well, I instantly see their face in my mind
I think about problems in my mind in the form of a conversation with myself
I see words in my "mind’s eye" when I think
I hear words in my "mind’s ear" when I think
When thinking about a social problem, I often talk it through in my head
When I hear someone talking, I see words written down in my mind
I often talk to myself internally while watching TV
When traveling to get to somewhere I tend to think more visually than verbally
I tend to think things through verbally when I am relaxing
I like to give myself some down time to talk through thoughts in my mind
When I am introduced to someone for the first time, I imagine what their name would look like when written down
A strategy I use to help me remember written material is imagining what the writing looks like
I hear a running summary of everything I am doing in my head
I rarely vocalize thoughts in my mind
If I am walking somewhere by myself, I frequently think of conversations that I’ve recently had
If I am walking somewhere by myself, I often have a silent conversation with myself
If I talk to myself in my head it is usually accompanied by visual imagery
My inner speech helps my imagination
I find it easy to decide if words rhyme by seeing their spelling in my mind’s eye
My memories often involve conversations I’ve had
I can easily imagine imagine the sound of a trumpet getting louder
I often use mental images or pictures to help me remember things
My memories are mainly visual in nature
I often enjoy the use of mental pictures to reminisce
My mental images are very vivid and photographic
I can close my eyes and easily picture a scene that I have experienced
I can easily imagine and mentally rotate three-dimensional geometric figures
In school, I had no problems with geometry
I find it difficult to imagine how a three-dimensional geometric figure would exactly look like when rotated
If I imagine my memories visually they are more often moving than static
I can easily choose to imagine this sentence in my mind pronounced unnaturally slowly
It is easy for me to imagine the sensation of licking a brick
I can easily imagine someone clearly talking, and then imagine the same voice with a heavy cold
I think I have a large vocabulary in my native language compared to others
The old saying “A picture is worth a thousand words” is certainly true for me
